# ****Getting started****

Run the following commands after downloading the starter code (you might have to install [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)):

npm install

vite

After that, going to http://localhost:5173/ in your browser should open up a skeleton React app. You can edit any file in ./src/ and in most cases the website will hot-reload.
